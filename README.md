# PageRank

Hi, 

I'm a beginner on Spark, coding in Python. 
I was looking for a very simple first project and read multiple explanations of the PageRank algorithm but none that didn't require using the Command Prompt. 
I hope my attempt, with a lot of explanations, is helpful.
You should start with the Jupyter Notebook which walks you through the Python code.
I hope this helps!
